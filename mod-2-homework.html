//       the line with '//' which indicates a comment.

// NOTE: console.log prints text to the browser console that you can enable
//       to see the output. It is a little bit more convenient than alert so
//       we will use it most of the time.

//---------------------------//
// Why should we use arrays? //
//---------------------------//
console.log("Why should we use arrays?");

// it is an easy way to keep information organized and to find information it is easy to manage 
// a lot of information using an array because you can add or remove some or a lot of information
// without going through each element.



//----------------------------------//
// Creating and initializing arrays //
//----------------------------------//
console.log("Creating and initializing arrays");

// 1. Study the following sequence: 1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 15, 14, 42, ...
//    Create an array with the first 25 elements of this sequence.
//    Obviously this has to be done programmatically.
var sequence = [1];

for(var i = 0;i < 25; i++){
    //i reference current index
    //i - 1 reference previous index
    if(i % 2 === 1){
        //odd
        sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] * 3;
    }
    else {
        sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] - 1;
    }
    console.log(sequence);
}


//-----------------//
// Adding elements //
//-----------------//
console.log("Adding elements");

// Use this array to answer the questions below.
var arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

// 1. Add 9 and 10 to the end of the array. Make sure you keep the order.
arr.push(9);
arr.push(10);
// 2. Add 0 and 1 to the beginning of the array. Make sure you keep the order.
arr.unshift(1);
arr.unshift(0);


//-------------------//
// Removing elements //
//-------------------//
console.log("Removing elements");

// Use the array from the 'Adding elements' section.

// 1. Remove 9 and 10 from the end of the array.
arr.pop();
arr.pop();
// 2. Remove 0 and 1 from the beginning of the array.
arr.shift();
arr.shift();


//-------------------------------------------------------//
// Adding and removing elements from a specific position //
//-------------------------------------------------------//
console.log("Adding and removing elements from a specific position");

// Use the array from the 'Adding elements' section.

// 1. Remove all elements except the first and last.
arr.splice(1, arr.length - 2);
// 2. Insert the numbers that were just removed back into the array.
//arr.splice(put numbers that is missing from original after running code)
// NOTE: arr should be back to its original state at this point.
arr.splice(1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);


//---------------------------------------------//
// Two-dimensional and multidimensional arrays //
//---------------------------------------------//
console.log("Two-dimensional and multidimensional arrays");

// 1. Multiply the row elements together in the two dimensional array below
//    and then sum the result. So for the array below one would get
//    (1*2*3)+(4*5*6)+(7*8*9). Print the result to the console.
//    NOTE: obviously the code should still work if the numbers in the array
//          are changed.

var arr12 = [[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]];

var firstArr = arr12[0][0] * arr12[0][1] * arr12[0][2];
var secondArr = arr12[1][0] * arr12[1][1] * arr12[1][2];
var thirdArr = arr12[2][0] * arr12[2][1] * arr12[2][2];
var sumArr = firstArr + secondArr + thirdArr;

console.log("References for JavaScript array methods");

// Use the following two arrays to answer the next questions.

var positiveNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0];
var negativeNumbers = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1];

// 1. Create a new array 'numbers' from the above arrays that contains all
//    numbers in order.

positiveNumbers.sort();
var nums = negativeNumbers.concat(positiveNumbers);
console.log(nums);

var numbers = null; // to be changed

// 2. Check if some numbers in the numbers array are larger than or equal to 0
//    and print the result to the console.

function checkNum(array){
    const mathNum = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        if(array[i] >= 0){
            mathNum.push(array[i]);
        }
    }
    return mathNum;
}


// 3. Create a new array that only contains the odd numbers from the numbers
//    array.

var result = nums.filter(function(x){
    return Math.abs(x) % 2 === 1;
});

// Only read ECMAScript sections.
